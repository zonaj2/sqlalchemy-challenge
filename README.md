## sqlalchemy-challenge
### Instructions
In this challenge I was awarded a trip to Hawaii.  To help plan the trip I decided to do a climate analysis of the area. 
The climate analysis involved:

#### Analyzing and exploring climate data from a sqllite file
I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. 
I looked at dates for precipitation levels for all stations, and temperature observations using the weather
station that had the most data (USC00519281).
I accomplished this by using: 
- SQLAlchemy ORM queries
- Pandas to display the data in a dataframe
- Matplotlib to plot a bar chart and histogram of results

#### Designing a Flask API climate app 
- included landing page, static API routes, dynamic API routes


#### Conclusion
In a year's worth of data the precipitation levels were the highest in
August and May, which are months I would avoid traveling to Hawaii.
The temperature analysis shows an average temperature of 71 degrees with a low of 54
and a high of 85.  This information doesn't really help me to determine what month 
would be the best to visit regarding temperature. If I did further analysis I would
look for months with average temperatures in the 70s and low precipitation.
